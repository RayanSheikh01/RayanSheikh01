### Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">





I'm Rayan Sheikh. A Computer Science student at the University of Aberdeen in the UK. I am a passionate developer, keen on machine learning, data science and software development. I believe developing software is an art, taking years to master. From thinking of the idea, progressing it, and then developing the solution to a level that is the best for the end user and for future developers is something that I love!
